# HireMe

## About
The corporate world requires trained and skilled
employees to work for it. Professionals along with freshly
graduated students need a medium to search for suitable
jobs and opportunities for their career growth. There
needs to be a benchmark professional networking social
media platform, which is required to establish the
fulfillment of these concerns.
 
Recruiters and employers can both use it to source candidates for employment.
With provisions for users to exhibit their resume, create
and build a professional profile, documenting skills, projects and qualifications and to apply to
various organizations and recommending themselves and
for companies to release vacancy and recruitment
notification and find the right candidate to hire, this
platform must provide an ideal environment for
everyone to satisfy their ambitions. 

This Project is an attempt to realise this idea of a user friendly social
network platform for simplifying the hiring process.
